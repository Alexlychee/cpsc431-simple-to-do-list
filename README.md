# cpsc431-simple-to-do-list
For this project we are tasked in creating a to-do or task list. The functional requirements will specify that the application should allow users to create a list of text items which they can then mark/unmark as completed. Data will persist by using a database. Users can create multiple lists and modify or delete them as well.
